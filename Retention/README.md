Suppose you were running grocery stores, financial services, or gym memberships, you would care about how many new customers engaged in your business as well as how many customers returned to you again. The metric, which indicates that scenario, is called [retention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_retention#:~:text=Customer%20retention%20refers%20to%20the,or%20to%20non%2Duse%20entirely.). High customer retention means they tend to return, continue to buy or in some other way not defect to another product or business, or to non-use entirely.
